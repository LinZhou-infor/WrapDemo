# WrapDemo

This repository demonstrates using Auto Layout with views that wrap.
It contains examples of text wrapping, and a custom view that implements its own wrapping.

These techniques are explained on dev etc: [Auto Layout and Views that Wrap](http://devetc.org/code/2014/07/07/auto-layout-and-views-that-wrap.html).
